# Learning Nim Language

I'm drawn to Nim mostly because it has almost all of the advantages of
Rust, without the Rust.

## Pros

* Really tiny, statically compiled binaries (akin to Rust)
* Minimal to no garbage collection
* Absolutely beautiful, simple syntax
* Transpile to C, C++, or JavaScript
* Seems to cater to low-level programmers while being high-level
* Has `nimscript` scripting support as well (with limited features)
* No low-level virtual machine (like LLVM)
* Three variable types: `var`, `let`, `const`
* Forces all symbols to be used (`discard`)

## Cons

* Perhaps a bit more "expressive" than people need
* A little to flexible in naming conventions
* "Significant white space" language
